**Initial Resume Relevance Score: 3 (Moderate)**

**Tailored Resume Relevance Score: 4 (High)**

**Analysis:**

The original resume demonstrates a strong background in research and data science, with relevant experience in algorithm design, statistical analysis, and machine learning. However, it lacks specific focus on the e-commerce/OTA industry and does not emphasize certain key skills mentioned in the job description, such as big data processing (Spark/Hadoop) and experience with recommendation systems.

**Tailoring Actions:**

1. **Keyword Optimization:** Incorporated keywords from the job description, such as "AI/ML/DL," "big data," "Spark/Hadoop," "recommendation systems," and "e-commerce," into the resume, particularly in the Skills section and the descriptions of relevant roles.
2. **Summary Update:** Modified the summary to highlight the candidate's experience in data science and their ability to derive actionable insights from large datasets, aligning it with the job description's focus on customer experience and business outcomes.
3. **Experience Modification:**
    *   Rephrased the responsibilities and achievements in the "Research Scientist" role at Rakuten Institute of Technology to emphasize experience with big data analysis, model implementation, and working with business owners, which aligns with the job description's requirement for experience in these areas.
    *   Added keywords related to "data engineering" and "big data framework" in the context of the candidate's experience at Rakuten, aligning with the "It's Great if You Have" section of the job description.
    *   Rephrased the "Data Scientist" role at Starlight to better emphasize experience with customer behavior analysis and predictive modeling, which are relevant to the job description's focus on maximizing customer experience.
4. **Skills Enhancement:**
    *   Added "PySpark" to the Programming Languages in the Skills section to align with the job description's mention of proficiency in languages like PySpark.
    *   Added "big data frameworks (Spark/Hadoop)" to the Supporting Technologies in the Skills section, directly addressing a skill mentioned in the "It's Great if You Have" section.

**ATS Optimization:**

*   Ensured the use of standard section headings (e.g., "Experience," "Education," "Skills").
*   Used clear and concise bullet points.
*   Avoided excessive formatting that could confuse ATS.
