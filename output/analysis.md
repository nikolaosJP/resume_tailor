Original Resume Relevance Score: 2/5

The original resume focuses heavily on quantitative finance and trading, with some data science experience. However, it lacks several key aspects highlighted in the Lead Data Scientist job description, such as transformer-based models, GenAI, and cloud computing. The skills section is also not tailored to the job requirements.
